# informations_about_AI
this folder shows some brief  information about AI, ML , statistics , mathematics and deep learning  
Every file talking about a topic :
1-machine learning algorithms file i am talking breif about : - Which machine learning algorithm should i use?
                                                              -  ML algorithms
2- P and NP problems file i am talking breif about  : - What is the P and NP problems and there examples
                                                      - The Use case Traveling salesman problem 
                                                      - the diffrience between P and NP
3- In statistics there are sampling techinques , In this file i am talking breifly about : -The probability sampling and its four types
                                                                                         -The Non-Probability Sampling and its four types
4-In statistics there are many types of data distribution , In this file i am talking breifly about : - Continuous and discrete distributions and its types
